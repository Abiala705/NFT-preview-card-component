## Overview

This project was done using HTML, CSS and Flexbox. I had to classify each sections into divs then work my way down. It took me about 3 hours for it to be completed. It allows the users to hover over the interactive elements specified in the style guide. I also maintained using @font face for the font while providing the directory to the font folder. I find the approach very easy.

## My process

I built the project using

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the flexbox properties more on a project after a while. Viewing each layout as a flexbox makes things very easy. I am gaining more confidence with setting the active states of different elements.

### Continued development

I will take my time to learn more on CSS grid for bigger web layout and see how flexbox relates with it. Working these concepts will make things easy. I will love to learn more on hovering over images.
